<strong>Problem 1:</strong>

Prove that <em>G </em><sup>∼</sup>= <em>H </em>if and only if <em>G </em><sup>∼</sup>= <em>H</em>.

<strong>Problem 2:</strong>

Prove that every regular bipartite graph has a perfect matching.

<strong>Problem 3:</strong>

Let <em>G </em>be a <em>k</em>-connected graph that is not a complete graph. Prove that for every edge <em>e </em>of <em>G</em>, if the result of contracting that edge is a graph that is no longer <em>k</em>-connected, then <em>G</em>−<em>e </em>is a <em>k</em>-connected graph.

<strong>Problem 4:</strong>

Let <em>T </em>be a tree (undirected). Suppose we have <em>k </em>vertex disjoint paths in <em>T </em>such that path <em>i </em>goes from leaf <em>u<sub>i </sub></em>to leaf <em>v<sub>i</sub></em>. Consider two leaves <em>a </em>and <em>b </em>of <em>T </em>different from {<em>u</em><sub>1</sub><em>,…,u<sub>k</sub>,v</em><sub>1</sub><em>,…,v<sub>k</sub></em>}, and consider the path from <em>a </em>to <em>b </em>in <em>T</em>. Suppose that the intersection of this <em>a</em>–<em>b </em>path with path <em>i</em>, for each <em>i</em>, is either ∅ or contains at least two different vertices. Prove that there exists <em>k </em>+ 1 vertex disjoint paths in <em>T </em>between the leaves {<em>a,b,u</em><sub>1</sub><em>,…,u<sub>k</sub>,v</em><sub>1</sub><em>,…,v<sub>k</sub></em>}.

<strong>Problem 5:</strong>

Let <em>G </em>be a simple plane graph in which all vertices have a degree that is a prime number (2<em>,</em>3<em>,</em>5<em>,</em>7<em>,…</em>). Furthermore, assume that <em>G </em>requires 4 colors to properly color its vertices but any subgraph of <em>G </em>requires only three colors. Prove that <em>G </em>must have either a vertex of degree 3 on a face of size 5 or less or a vertex of degree 5 incident to 4 faces of size 3.

<strong>Problem 6:</strong>

Let graph <em>G </em>require ∆(<em>G</em>) + 1 colors to properly color its edges. Assume <em>G </em>is critical for this coloring. Prove that <em>G </em>is bridgeless.

<strong>Problem 7:</strong>

Let <em>G </em>be a directed graph, let <em>xy </em>be an edge and assume <em>G</em>−<em>xy </em>is bridgeless. Prove that if <em>G </em>has a nowhere-zero 2-flow then <em>G </em>− <em>xy </em>has a nowhere-zero 3-flow.

<strong>Problem 8:</strong>

Prove that having treewidth at most <em>k </em>is a hereditary property.

We know that if each graph in a set of graphs has treewidth at most <em>k</em>, for some constant <em>k</em>, then we can solve problems such as Hamiltonian cycle, graph isomorphism, vertex cover, and 3-color on these graphs using dynamic programming where the running time of the algorithm is a polynomial on the size the graph. Explain why dynamic programming is able to solve these problems and can work in polynomial time. Let <em>α </em>be the following shape.    <strong>Problem 10:</strong>




Describe entries of the matrix <em>M<sub>α </sub></em>representing this shape on a Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph <em>G</em>(<em>n,</em>1<em>/</em>2).
